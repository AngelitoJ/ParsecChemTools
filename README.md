Computational Chemistry formats Parsec tools

This package contains a set of parse modules from the most widely used computational chemistry tools


  ¡¡¡THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Roadmap:

1. Port modules from existing projects
2. Clean them up (dependecies)
3. Export top level parser as used int those projects (to allow reintegrate to them as a library).
4. make parsers to return a record describing while Molcas or Gaussian formats
5. Export combinators to build parsecs on demand to use on diferent tasks.
6. make a DSL for applicative generation of customs parsers
7. Provide lenses to all sections ine the parsinc records
